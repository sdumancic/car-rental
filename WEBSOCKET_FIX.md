# WebSocket Connection Fix

## Problem
The WebSocket was connecting successfully (console showed "WebSocket connected"), but the UI remained stuck on "Connecting..." status, preventing users from sending messages.

## Root Cause
WebSocket events (onopen, onmessage, onerror, onclose) run outside of Angular's zone, which means Angular's change detection doesn't automatically trigger when these events fire. Even though the connection status was being updated in the service, the component's view wasn't being updated.

## Solution
Wrapped all WebSocket event handlers with `NgZone.run()` to ensure they execute inside Angular's zone, triggering automatic change detection.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `chat.service.ts`:
- Added `NgZone` import and injection
- Wrapped `onopen` callback with `ngZone.run()`
- Wrapped `onmessage` callback with `ngZone.run()`
- Wrapped `onerror` callback with `ngZone.run()`
- Wrapped `onclose` callback with `ngZone.run()`
- Added `getReadyState()` and `getCurrentStatus()` methods for debugging

### 2. Updated `chat.component.ts`:
- Reordered subscriptions (connection status first, then messages)
- Added extensive console logging for debugging
- Added `debugConnection()` method to help diagnose connection issues
- Improved `sendMessage()` to log why messages can't be sent

## How It Works Now

1. User opens chat page
2. Component subscribes to connection status observable
3. Component calls `chatService.connect(userId)`
4. WebSocket `onopen` event fires
5. **NgZone.run()** ensures the status update runs inside Angular's zone
6. BehaviorSubject emits 'connected' status
7. Component receives update and Angular's change detection updates the UI
8. User can now send messages

## Testing
1. Open the chat page
2. Check browser console for logs:
   - "Connecting to WebSocket URL: ws://localhost:9000/customer-support-agent/[userId]"
   - "WebSocket ONOPEN event fired! readyState: 1"
   - "Connection status set to connected inside NgZone"
   - "Connection status changed to: connected"
3. The header should show "Connected" in green
4. The input field should be enabled
5. You can now type and send messages

## Debug Console Logs
When trying to send a message, the console will show:
- Component connectionStatus
- Service getCurrentStatus()
- Service getReadyState() (0=CONNECTING, 1=OPEN, 2=CLOSING, 3=CLOSED)
- Service isConnected()

## Additional Improvements
- Added detailed logging throughout the connection lifecycle
- Better error handling and status tracking
- Debug methods to inspect connection state at runtime

## WebSocket Ready States
- 0 (CONNECTING): Connection is being established
- 1 (OPEN): Connection is open and ready to communicate
- 2 (CLOSING): Connection is closing
- 3 (CLOSED): Connection is closed

The fix ensures that when readyState becomes 1 (OPEN), the UI immediately reflects this change.
